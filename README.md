This is a [``template``](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-templates-source) for [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16), a ``builder`` like [this](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder-php) is required to build the themes.

After building, put the built ``*.theme`` files into ``~/.local/share/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes/``, and the themes will be available under ``Edit > Preferences > Colors > Presets``
